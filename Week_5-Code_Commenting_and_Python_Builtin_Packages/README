Week 5 Consolidation Task - Arithmetic Quiz

**INTRODUCTION**
The programme is a Command Line Interface (CLI) arithmetic quiz.

The user answers five questions on the following mathematical concepts:
1) squares
2) division remainders
3) factorials
4) exponents
5) addition

Using the python random module, the programme can generate different questions everytime the programme is run. Using the timer module, Python can measure the time taken to complete all five questions. 

Extensive comments are used in the source code to aid further developers and users.

**INSTALLATION**
The programme contains a python file, which can be downloaded and run directly. No attachments are neeeded.

Run the program with CLI on Windows:
python C:\path\to\Arithmetic_Quiz_Including_Comments.py
It can also be open directly on a Python runtime software.

** INSTRUCTIONS **
Answer each question by typing in the digits, and press enter. 
The quiz measures the time taken to answer the questions from the time the first question is displayed to the time you press enter for the final question. This time is displayed at the end of the programme's running. There is no time limit to answer the questions, however.
