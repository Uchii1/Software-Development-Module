# Software-Development-Module
This is a repository to document work for my Software Development module (semester 1). It contains the necessary work for weeks 3 to 9.

Within the repository, there is a labelled folder for each week, with the consolidation tasks documented.
There is a README file in every week's folder, which provides specific information on the week's work.
