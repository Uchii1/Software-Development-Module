Week 7 Consolidation Task : Number Guessing Game

**INTRODUCTION
The programme is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) number game. 
The user is prompted to guess a fixed number, which is between 1 and 10. 
The number is randomly generated using Python's random module, and so changes everytime the programme is run.

**INSTALLATION**
The programme contains a python file, which can be downloaded and run directly. No attachments are neeeded.

Run the program with CLI on Windows
<file path> python Number_Guessing_Game_Using_Loops.py
It can also be open directly on a Python runtime software.

**INSTRUCTIONS**
When prompted, type in a number and hit ENTER. 
The goal is to guess the fixed random number between 1 and 10, within eight attempts.

If your input is not a valid number, or is blank, you will receive and error message to enter a valid integer and will be prompted to try again. Inputs that are not valid integers will still count towards the eight attemtps.
When you correctly guess the number, or use up the eight guesses, the programme terminates.
