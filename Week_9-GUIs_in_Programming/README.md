**README FILE- week 9 consolidation **

** INTRODUCTION**
The project is a calculator webpage with a Python backend. It applies HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PyScript.


** INSTALLATION**
Install the programme by downloading the HTML and CSS files. The Python backend is written directly into the html file, with Pyscript. This helps to keep installation simple. 


** INSTRUCTIONS**
There are two sections:

* Arithmetic Calculator - Type the mathematical expression into the textbox, and click the 'solve' button. The backend uses the Python 'eval' function to evaluate these expressions and returns an answer.
Remember to use * for multiplication (for example, 3 x 2 = (3*2)), and ** for exponents and roots (for example, √9 = (9**0.5)).
Also, the constants pi (3.142) and g (9.82) are hard-coded in the Python backend, to enable the user to apply these easily.
Therefore, to find the circumference of a circle of diameter 7, simply type in: 7*pi. 
The Python backend reads this as 7 x 3.142.


* Quadratic Calculator - Type the coeficients in your equation into the textboxes. 
The inputs accept only digits. If the input is invalid (for example, if your value for a is 0), you will receive an error message and can try again.


** STORAGE**
There is no long-term storage file, but the PyScript function will store the single last calculation you solve with the arithmetic calculator, and displays this on your next visit, after you click into the textbox.

During each use, the webpage stores and displays all the calculations done with the arithmetic calculator on that visit. However, this is lost when the page is closed or refreshed, except for the last calculation.
